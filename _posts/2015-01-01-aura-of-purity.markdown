**4th-level abjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (30-foot radius)

**Components**: V

**Duration**: up to 10 minutes

Purifying energy radiates from you in an aura with a 30-foot radius. Until the spell ends, the aura moves with you, centered on you. Each nonhostile creature in the aura (including you) canâ€™t become diseased, has resistance to poison damage, and has advantage on saving throws against being poisoned.

Only one aura spell can be active at a time. Casting another aura spell will cancel the previous one.
