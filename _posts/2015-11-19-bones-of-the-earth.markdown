**6th-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You cause up to six trees to burst from places on the ground that you can see within range. Each tree is a cylinder that has a diameter of 5 feet and a height of up to 60 feet. The ground where a tree appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target ground under a creature if that creature is Medium or smaller. Each tree has AC 15, a damage threshold of 10, and 18 hit points. The trees are immune to poison and psionic damage, and are resistant to piercing, slashing and bludgeoning damage. When reduced to 0 hit points, a tree falls to the ground and creates difficult terrain that lasts until the tree is cleared.

If a tree is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the tree takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained, pinched between the tree and the obstacle. The restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (the creature’s choice) against the spell’s save DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained and must either move off the tree or fall off it.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can create two additional trees for each slot level above 6th.
