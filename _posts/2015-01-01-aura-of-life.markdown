**4th-level abjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (30-foot radius)

**Components**: V

**Duration**: Up to 10 minutes

Life-preserving energy radiates from you in an aura with a 30-foot radius. Until the spell ends, the aura moves with you, centered on you. Each nonhostile creature in the aura (including you) has resistance to necrotic damage, and its hit point maximum canâ€™t be reduced. In addition, a nonhostile, living creature regains the maximum number of hit points possible from any healing.

Only one aura spell can be active at a time. Casting another aura spell will cancel the previous one.
