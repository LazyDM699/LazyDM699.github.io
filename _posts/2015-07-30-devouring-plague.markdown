**6th-level necromancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 5 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can’t reduce the target’s hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature’s hit point maximum to return to normal. If the disease is not cured within 24 hours, the creature must make a constitution saving throws every 24 hours until the disease is cured. On a failed saving throw the creature takes an additional 14d6 necrotic damage, and if this damage would reduce the creature to 0 hit points it dies.
