**1st-level abjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take when you take cold, fire, or lightning damage

**Range**: Self

**Components**: S

**Duration**: 1 round

The spell captures some of the incoming energy, lessening its effect on you and storing it for your next melee attack. You have resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn.
