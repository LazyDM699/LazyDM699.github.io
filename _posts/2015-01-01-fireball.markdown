**3rd-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 90 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

As an action you begin coalescing a fiery sphere between you hands. On your next turn, as a bonus action you may send out this sphere at a target area within range, where it then blossom with a dull roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that arenâ€™t being worn or carried.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
