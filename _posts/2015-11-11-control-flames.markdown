**Transmutation cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: S

**Duration**: Instantaneous or 1 minute (see below)

You choose nonmagical flame that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You affect it in one of the following ways:

 * You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube.

 * You cause simple shapesâ€”such as the vague form of a creature, or an inanimate object, to appear within the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for 1 minute.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.
