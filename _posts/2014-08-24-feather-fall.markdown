**Range**: self

**Components**: V, M (a small feather or a piece of down)

Your rate of descent whilst falling slows to 60 feet per round until the spell ends. If you land before the spell ends, it you land before the spell ends you take no falling damage and can land on your feet, and the spell ends for you.
