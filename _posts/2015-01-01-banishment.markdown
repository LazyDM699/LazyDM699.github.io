**5th-level abjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (an item distasteful to the target)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to send one creature not native to your current plane of existance back to its home plane. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished.

The target is banished with a faint popping noise, returning to its home plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesnâ€™t return.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th.
