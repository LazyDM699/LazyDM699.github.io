**4th-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 bonus action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a bit of phosphorous or a firefly)

**Duration**: 10 minutes

Pale blue wisps of energy wreathe your body for the duration. You can end the spell early by using a bonus action to dismiss it.

The shield grants you resistance to fire damage. In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the attacker takes 2d8 cold damage.
