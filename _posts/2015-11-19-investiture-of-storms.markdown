**6th-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Until the spell ends, wind whirls around you, and you gain the following benefits:

 * Ranged weapon attacks made against you have disadvantage on the attack roll.

 * You are immune to lightning damage for the duration.

 * You can use your action to chain lightning between yourself and targets around you. Choose up to 3 creatures within 30 feet of you on each of your turns. Each creature must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 2d12 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If it fails its save it also loses its reactions until the start of your next turn.
