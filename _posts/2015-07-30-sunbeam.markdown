**5th-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (120-foot line)

**Components**: V, S, M (a magnifying glass)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide, 120-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d8 radiant damage and is blinded until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes automatically fail the initial save, and have disadvantage on subsequent saving throw to remove blindness.
