**2st-level necromancy**

**Casting Time**: 1 bonus action

**Range**: 90 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

The corpse of a recently deceased creature rapidly bloats at your command and erupts in a gruesome explosion. You target the corpse of a creature that's been dead for no longer than 1 minute that you can see within range, detonating it. Each creature within a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that corpse must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 2d8 necrotic damage and 2d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The size of the explosion increases by 5 feet for every size larger than medium.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
