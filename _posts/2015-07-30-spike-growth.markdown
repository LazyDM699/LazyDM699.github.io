**2nd-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.
