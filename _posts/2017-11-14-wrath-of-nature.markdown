**6th-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minute

You call out to the spirits of nature to rouse them against your enemies. The spirits cause trees, and grasses in a 90-foot radius sphere centered on you to become animated until the spell ends.

**Grasses and Undergrowth.** Any area of ground in the cube that is covered by grass or undergrowth is difficult terrain for your enemies.

**Trees.** At the start of each of your turns, each of your enemies within 10 feet of any tree in the cube must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 slashing damage from whipping branches.

**Roots and Vines.** At the end of each of your turns, one creature of your choice that is on the ground in the cube must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained until the spell ends. A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC, ending the effect on itself on a success.
