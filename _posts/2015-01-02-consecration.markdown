**3rd-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (15-foot radius)

**Components**: V, S, M (a holy symbol)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You infuse the ground around you with radiant energy, to a radius of 15 ft. Undead, fiends and abberations treat this ground as difficult terrain and take radiant damage equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting modifier when entering the area for the first time on a turn or starting its turn there.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the radius increases by 15 ft for each slot level above 3rd.
