**5th-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 90 feet

**Components**: V, S, M 

**Duration**: Instantaneous

A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free.
