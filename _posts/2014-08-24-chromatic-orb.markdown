**1st-level evocation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 90 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You hurl a 4-inch-diameter sphere of energy at a creature that you can see within range. You choose cold, fire, or lightning for the type of orb you create, and then make a ranged spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, the creature takes 3d8 of the type you chose.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
